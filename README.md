Research paper for "Tidy data structure to support exploration and modeling of temporal-context data".

## Clone the repo with `git-lfs`

The repo contains a relatively larger data file `flights.rds` than what Github recommends, which doesn't fit into a normal git workflow. In order to clone this repo, you need to download and install a git plugin called [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com) for versioning large files, and then set up Git LFS using command `git lfs install` in console.
